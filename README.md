# eCar

eCar company is going to introduce new way pricing in their new, successful backoffice supporting electric vehicles charging network. 

## Requirements
 - [x] Ability to define and calculate a price via API.  
 - [x] A price definition will contain price per minute and can be defined for specific duration, e.g. one price before noon and different one afternoon 
 - [x] A calculation input will contain start and end datetime of charging process and customer id 
 - [x] For VIP customers we will grant 10% discount 
 - [x] An application should be able to be launched from command line with single command like "java â€“jar...." 
 - [x] A solution should require no additional software to be installed except for JRE 8

## Assumptions
 - Price definition **can** have a time range, but it is not required.
 - If price definition does not have a time specified, it is assumed it applies all day long *00:00 - 23:59:59* and becomes default price
 - Only one *default price* can be defined
 - If price definition is fully defined (has time range) then it has priority before default one
 - System rejects a price definition if there is already price in the system which overlaps with the new one
 - We always want to earn money, so if there is no customer in our repository we treat him as standard one
 - System is in the same time zone than the customer
 
## Algorithms
There are two types of charge computation algorithms. One creates a daily map with prices. The other one computes a charge using joda overlaps method. Default is the second one. You can easily change it using [Togglz console](https://ecar-sadel.azurewebsites.net/togglz)   

## Additional methods
 - Price and customers can be deleted
 - Price and customers can be listed
  
## Deployment
~~System is continually delivered to *Azure*. It can be reached at [eCar](https://ecar-sadel.azurewebsites.net/)~~
It has [SwaggerUI](https://ecar-sadel.azurewebsites.net/swagger-ui.html) for a user friendly testing and [Togglz console](https://ecar-sadel.azurewebsites.net/togglz) to easily change calculation algorithm.
